"""``ToolDocument`` — the mutable representation of a parsed Galaxy tool.

A ``ToolDocument`` wraps the parsed lxml tree, which is the **source of truth**:
lxml preserves CDATA sections, comments, attribute data, and attribute order
exactly, so a downstream formatter can mutate and re-serialise it faithfully.
There is deliberately no serialization method — exposing the tree *is* the
contract owed to that downstream project.

``model()`` returns a derived, read-only xsdata typed view for the tool's
profile, re-bound from the current tree on demand.
